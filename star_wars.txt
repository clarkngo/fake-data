{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Star Wars'' opening crawl }}
[[Image:Opening crawl.jpg|thumb|300px|Three [[Film frame|frames]] representative of opening sequences from films in the [[Skywalker Saga]]. The phrase "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...." which remains static on the screen and the ''Star Wars'' logo which shrinks to a central point are common to all of the films and are followed by a film specific opening crawl.  The example shown comes from a post-1981 re-release as ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope]]''.]]
The '''''Star Wars'' opening crawl''' is a signature device of the opening sequences of every numbered film of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' series, an American [[epic film|epic]] [[space opera]] franchise created by [[George Lucas]]. Within a black sky background featuring a smattering of stars, the crawl is preceded both by the static blue text, '''"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...."''' and by the ''Star Wars'' logo which recedes toward a central point on the screen before disappearing.  The crawl text, which describes the [[backstory]] and context of the film, then recedes toward a higher point in relation to the screen and with an apparent effect of disappearing in the distance. The visuals are accompanied by the "[[Star Wars Theme|Main Title Theme]]", composed by [[John Williams]].

This sequence has featured at the beginning each of the main ''Star Wars'' saga theatrical films produced by [[Lucasfilm]]. Although it has retained the same basic elements, the opening crawl has significantly evolved throughout the series.{{explain|date=March 2020}} It is one of the most immediately recognizable elements of the franchise and has been frequently parodied.

The opening crawl was not used in the animated film [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'']] or in the ''Star Wars'' "Anthology" films, ''[[Rogue One]]'' and [[Solo: A Star Wars Story|''Solo'']], although all three films begin with the opening text, "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....". Additionally, the opening  sequence of ''Solo'' continues with a short backstory presented in the same style as the opening text, while ''The Clone Wars'' uses a narrator to provide exposition in a similar style to a [[newsreel]].

==Structure==
Each film opens with the static blue text, "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....", followed by the ''Star Wars'' [[logo]] shrinking in front of a field of stars, as if moving away from the viewer. Initially the logo's extremities are beyond the edge of the frame. While the logo is retreating, the "crawl" text begins, starting with the film's episode number and [[Subtitle (titling)|subtitle]] (with the exception of the original release of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''&nbsp;– [[Star Wars opening crawl#Episode IV opening crawl|see below]]), and followed by a three-paragraph prologue to the film. The text scrolls up and away from the bottom of the screen towards a [[vanishing point]] above the top of the frame in a [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] projection. Each version of the opening crawl ends with a four-dot [[ellipsis]], except for ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' which has a three-dot ellipsis. When the text has nearly reached the vanishing point, it fades out, the camera [[Tilt (camera)|tilts]] down (or, in the case of ''Episode II: Attack of the Clones'', up), and the film begins.<ref name="EpI Commentary">''Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' DVD commentary</ref>

Several words are in all-capital letters to stress their importance: "[[Death Star|DEATH STAR]]" in ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', "[[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|GALACTIC EMPIRE]]" in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', "[[Clone trooper|ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC]]" in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'', "[[First Order (Star Wars)|FIRST ORDER]]", "[[New Republic (Star Wars)|REPUBLIC]]" and "[[Resistance (Star Wars)|RESISTANCE]]" in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'', "[[First Order (Star Wars)|FIRST ORDER]]" and "[[Resistance (Star Wars)|RESISTANCE]]" again in ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|The Last Jedi]]'', and "[[Revenge|REVENGE]]", "[[Palpatine|EMPEROR PALPATINE]]", "[[Princess Leia|GENERAL LEIA ORGANA]]", "[[Rey (Star Wars)|REY]]", "[[First Order (Star Wars)|FIRST ORDER]]", and "[[Kylo Ren|KYLO REN]]" in ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker|The Rise of Skywalker]]''. Each line of the text spans the width of the screen when it enters from the bottom. In the [[Pan and scan|"fullscreen"]] (4:3 [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] for standard-definition television) versions of the films, the full lines of text are cut off on the sides until they have scrolled further onto the screen.  As a result, by the time the full lines are visible, the text is much smaller and harder to read.  In addition, the viewer also has less time to read it.

==Origin==
[[File:Flash Gordon (1940) - Opening Crawl.jpg|thumb|The opening crawl as seen at the beginning of an episode of ''[[Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe]]''.]]
[[File:Union Pacific opening crawl.jpg|thumb|The opening crawl of Cecil B. DeMille's ''Union Pacific'' (1939)]]
[[File:Star wars 1977 us.svg|thumb|Dan Perri's rejected ''Star Wars'' logotype]]
Lucas has stated that the opening crawl was inspired by the opening crawls used at the beginning of each episode of the original ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' and ''[[Buck Rogers]]'' film serials, which were the inspiration for Lucas to write much of the ''Star Wars'' saga.<ref name="EpIII Commentary">''Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'' DVD commentary</ref> The development of the opening crawl came about as part of a collaboration between Lucas and the seasoned film title designer [[Dan Perri]]. In 1976, Lucas invited Perri to [[Industrial Light & Magic]], Lucasfilm's post-production operation at [[Van Nuys]], California. Perri, who had previously worked on ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' and ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', suggested that they take inspiration from the 1939 [[Cecil B. DeMille]] film, ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'', whose opening credits are shown distorted by a sharp perspective and rolling along a [[Track (rail transport)|railroad track]] towards a distant [[vanishing point]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Lucas was keen on the idea, so Perri developed sketches and prototype mechanical artwork. One of the earliest iterations of the opening crawl is evidenced in [[storyboard]]s drawn by the production artist [[Alex Tavoularis]], depicting the title “THE STAR WARS” as a three-dimensional logo.<ref name="artofthetitle">{{cite web|last1=Perkins|first1=Will|title=Star Wars|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/star-wars/|website=Art of the Title|accessdate=8 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402074725/http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/star-wars/|archivedate=2 April 2016|date=16 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Perri also designed a [[logotype]], consisting of block-capital letters filled with stars and skewed towards a vanishing point to follow the same perspective as the opening crawl. Lucas eventually rejected Perri's logo due to readability problems, turning instead to the graphic designer [[Suzy Rice]], an art director at the [[Los Angeles]] [[advertising agency]] [[Seiniger Advertising]]. Lucas had commissioned Rice to design a promotional brochure that was to be distributed to cinema theatre owners. He instructed Rice to produce a logo that would intimidate the viewer, and he reportedly asked for the logo to appear "very [[fascism|fascist]]" in style. Rice, inspired by historical German [[typography]], produced a bold logotype using an outlined, modified [[Helvetica|Helvetica Black]]. After some feedback from Lucas, Rice decided to join the ''S'' and ''T'' of ''STAR'' and the ''R'' and ''S'' of ''WARS''. Lucas's producer, [[Gary Kurtz]], found that Rice's logo worked well in the opening title; the logo was modified further to flatten the  pointed tips on the letter ''W'' before it was inserted into the final cut. While Perri's skewed logo did not appear on-screen, it was used widely on pre-release print advertising, and it featured prominently on [[film poster]]s promoting the release of ''Star Wars'' on cinema billboards in 1977 (notably [[Tom Jung]]'s ''[[:File:StarWarsMoviePoster1977.jpg|Style ‘A’ poster]]'', the [[:File:Bros Hildebrandt Star Wars quad poster.jpg|''Style ‘B’'' poster]] by the [[Brothers Hildebrandt]] and [[Tom Chantrell]]'s [[:File:Tom Chantrell Star Wars quad poster 1977.jpg|''Style ‘C’'' poster]]).<ref name="taylor-logo">{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Taylor|first1=Chris|title=How Star Wars Conquered the Universe: The Past, Present, and Future of a Multibillion Dollar Franchise|date=2014|publisher=Head of Zeus|isbn=9781784970451|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z7GbBAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT186&dq=suzy%20rice%20star%20wars%20logo&pg=PT185#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=1 June 2016|chapter=11.

In a 2005 interview, George Lucas described how the final phrasing of the text for ''Star Wars'' came about. "The crawl is such a hard thing because you have to be careful that you're not using too many words that people don't understand. It's like a poem. I showed the very first crawl to a bunch of friends of mine in the 1970s. It went on for six paragraphs with four sentences each. [[Brian De Palma]] was there...". De Palma helped to edit the text into the form used in the film.<ref>Pearlman, Cindy (May 15, 2005). [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20050515/ai_n14631916 The Force].

==Production==
According to [[Dennis Muren]], who worked on the first six films, crawls on the [[Star Wars#Original trilogy|original trilogy]] films were accomplished by filming physical models laid out on the floor. The models were approximately 60&nbsp;cm (2') wide and 1.80&nbsp;m (6') long. The crawl effect was accomplished by the camera moving longitudinally along the model. It was difficult and time-consuming to achieve a smooth scrolling effect. Furthermore, different versions in other languages (such as German, French and Spanish) were produced by [[Industrial Light & Magic]].<ref name="EpI Commentary"/><ref name="EpIV Commentary">''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'' DVD commentary</ref>

With the advent of [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated graphics]], the crawls for the [[Star Wars#Prequel trilogy|prequel trilogy]] were achieved much more quickly.<ref name="EpI Commentary"/>  The 2004 DVD special edition versions of the original trilogy were later updated with computer-generated crawls [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases|as part of their restoration and enhancement]].

Lucasfilm president [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] stated that the 2016 spin-off film ''[[Rogue One]]'' would "more than likely" eschew certain traditional elements of the franchise, including the crawl, in an effort to distinguish it from the main film series.<ref name="polygon-rogueone">{{cite web|title=''Rogue One'' is bucking a ''Star Wars'' tradition|url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/11/22/13718828/rogue-one-star-wars-tradition|first=Julia|last=Alexander|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=Vox Media|date=November 22, 2016|accessdate=March 13, 2018}}</ref> In fact, ''Rogue One'' retains "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...", but then immediately cuts to the opening scene with no crawl. At the end of the opening scene, the title "ROGUE ONE" recedes against a star field, like the "STAR WARS" title of the main series, then there is a cut to the next scene.

The second spin-off film ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story|Solo]]'' does not feature a crawl, but does feature an introductory text shown sentence by sentence in the same font and color as and immediately after "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....".<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/star-wars/feature/a857379/solo-a-star-wars-story-opening-crawl/ Does Solo: A Star Wars Story have an opening crawl?]</ref>

==''Episode IV'' opening crawl==
The opening crawl in the first ''Star Wars'' film is very different from Lucas's original intention. The original text, used in the rough cut he showed to friends and studio executives in February 1977, appears in the [[Star Wars (1977 comic book)|Marvel Comics adaptation of the film]]. When originally released in May 1977, the first film was simply titled ''Star Wars'', as [[20th Century Fox]] forbade Lucas to use a subtitle on grounds that it could be confusing, since there had been no other ''Star Wars'' movies prior to 1977.<ref name="EpI Commentary"/><ref name="EpIV Commentary"/> In addition, it was not certain if the film would be followed with a sequel. When ''The Empire Strikes Back'' was released in 1980, the episode number, "Episode V", and subtitle "THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK" appeared as the first two lines of the opening crawl. To match its sequel's crawl, the episode number "Episode IV" and subtitle "A NEW HOPE" were added for the film's theatrical re-release in April 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/films/star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope|title=Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|work=StarWars.com}}</ref> The original version, without the subtitle, was not released again until the [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases#2006 Star Wars Trilogy DVD Box Set|2006 limited edition DVDs]]. Also, it should be noticed that the original version of ''Episode IV''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s crawl features a lowercase "R" for "Rebel spaceships" and "Rebel spies", as, at the time, "Rebel" (in its ''Star Wars'' meaning), just like "Imperial", was not considered some sort of [[demonym]]-like adjective as it is now.
